# Amazon Returns Tab

Adds a **Returns** tab directly to the **Your Orders** page on Amazon, so you can jump to the return center in one click.

## What it does

Amazon places the returns page in a separate location from the main order tabs. This extension adds a native-looking **Returns** tab alongside the existing navigation, making it faster to access your returns.

* Lightweight and single-purpose
* No tracking, ads, or analytics
* No data collection
* Runs only on Amazon order pages
